    text: As a general rule, any death caused by injuries received in a fight, argument, quarrel, assault, or commission of a crime is classified as murder or nonnegligent manslaughter. The FBI counts one offense for each victim of murder or nonnegligent manslaughter. Accidental deaths, traffic fatalities, suicides, negligent manslaughters, justifiable homicides, or attempted murders are not included.
