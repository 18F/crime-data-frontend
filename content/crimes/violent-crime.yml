caveats:
  - heading: Definition
    text: In the Uniform Crime Reporting Program, violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes involve force or threat of force.

  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: This data reflects the Hierarchy Rule, which requires that only the most serious offense in a multiple-offense criminal incident be counted. The descending order of violent crimes are murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, followed by the property crimes of burglary, larceny theft, and motor vehicle theft. Although arson is also a property crime, the Hierarchy Rule does not apply to it. In cases in which an arson occurs in conjunction with another violent or property crime, both crimes are reported.
