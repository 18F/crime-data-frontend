  - heading: These crimes are often underreported
    text: It is important to note that this is only one view of a complex issue—the law enforcement perspective. The investigation of human trafficking by local, state, tribal, and federal agencies is one facet of this crime. However, due to the nature of human trafficking, many of these crimes are never reported to law enforcement. In addition to the law enforcement facet in fighting these crimes, there are victim service organizations whose mission it is to serve the needs of the victims of human trafficking. To get the complete picture of human trafficking, it’s important to gather information from all of these sources.
